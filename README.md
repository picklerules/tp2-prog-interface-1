# JavaScript To-Do List Manager

This project is a dynamic To-Do List Manager built using JavaScript, designed to demonstrate asynchronous request handling, interaction with an SQL database, and client-side routing. Developed as part of a school project, this application offers a practical example of creating a single-page application (SPA) with real-time data management capabilities.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Utilizes async requests to fetch, add, delete, and update to-do items without needing to reload the page.
- **SQL Database Integration:** Manages to-do items persistently with an SQL database backend.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Implements a simple router to navigate between different views or parts of the application without full page refreshes.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface that allows for easy management of to-do tasks.
